// Create a program to output the falling distance of an object being dropped from a height
// Write a program that will output the distance the ball has fallen in each 1-second interval for the first 30 seconds along with the total distance travelled at the end of each interval.
// distance = 1/2gt^2

 Program Testing:
The output time for part 2 was 55.3 seconds which gave the closest total distance value to 15,000. This was verified using an online website to ensure that the answer was correct to 1 decimal place.
 
To test whether the code worked I picked distance values from the total distance column and then used an online calculator to
 figure out the time taken to travel that distance. I then verified whether the calculated time aligned with the time in the table
 corresponding to the chosen total distance.
 
 
 Tested time values:                                    Calculated Distance (using online software):                           Does it correspond to table value?

 To test the logic I changed the max value of i in the for loop to allow the time to be less than 10,000
 - the output gave the total distance and distance during interval up to 9999 (tests the logic of printing time values)
 - the final value: 9999 seconds gave an output total distance of 490234438.403
 - this was then verified using an online calculator and it was correct
 
 To test whether I could further increase the resolution, I tried to make the interval range 0.1 to further test the program logic
 - the more precise time outputed by the prgram was 55.310 which gave a total distance of 15000.233
 - this was verified using the same online calculator
 
 To test the distance during interval a calculator was used to take the difference between the total distance of two consecutive times and check if the difference was equal to the distance during interval at the higher of the two times.
 e.g. total distance at 5 seconds: 122.583
      total distance at 6 seconds: 176.520
      difference = 176.520 - 122.583 = 53.937 --> corresponds to distance during interval in table for 6 seconds (higher time)
 
 The code will work for i values up to 2^53 - 1 without losing precision. */
